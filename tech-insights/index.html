  <h1>How important is CSS in the modern web-dev world?</h1>
  <p></p>
  <p>Obviously the look & feel of your web-site is important.  I would even suggest that it's equally important as the information you are trying to display.  Every website is trying to give some sort of info to the outside world and you might have the most important bit of information on your site but if it's an ugly or hard to use website.  Your message will be lost, forgotten and painfully never seen.  In the eternal battle of sizzle vs. steak.  You need both.</p>
  <h1>Now, Which one of the mentioned examples would you like to design?</h1>
  <p>I really liked most of the 28 website (One was 404) showcased but my top two were <a href="http://rleonardi.com/">rleonard.com</a> & <a href="https://www.mammothparty.com/">Mammoth Booth</a>.  I'm a bit of a retro gamer and I liked the whole vibe of Robby Leonard's personal page.  It looked like a lot of effort was placed into showcasing his CSS talents.  I had a special interest in the Mammoth Booth website because I own & operate a Photo Booth Company and I honestly think I can so a much better site than Mammoth!  Maybe not right now but I plan to do it by the end of this course. </p>

  <p>I'll keep a closer eye out on website designs over the next few months and hopefully develop a modern & stylish design for my Photo Booth site.</p>
